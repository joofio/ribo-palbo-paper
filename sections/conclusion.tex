For conclusions and next steps, we feel we have demonstrated that the ribociclib is a good alternative to palbociclib. We still dot not have sufficient evidence to state that palbociclib is actually better than hormonotherapty regarding Overall Survival. However, it is sufficient to state that CDK4/6i have impact on PFS.
Further information about the population could be interesting, as well as providing information about safety, economic impact and quality of life. Especially the characterization of the population in terms of biomarkers could be very useful. We aim to address those issues in sequencing papers. 
Finally, since all of this data was collected from a single institution, we can not generalize the results to the entire population. However, we believe that this study can be used as a starting point for further research in this area. Additionally, this evidence was generated from observational data. Although we adjusted for confounding factors, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding. However, the propensity scores matching allows for a more robust comparison between the two groups, there is still the possibility of unmeasured confounders.
