 The median OS in the entire population treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors was 46 months (95\%CI 39.4–55.6). Median PFS was 20.1 months (95\%CI 18.3–24.2). 
Following this, we compared Palbociclib and riboclib as first-line treatments. We found that regarding OS, there is no significant difference between the two, but ribociclib is significantly better in terms of PFS (p-value $\le$ 0.001) (figure \ref*{fig:interest}).
Additionally, we compared the same CDK4/6 inhibitors with letrozole as a combination only. Regarding this scenario, we found out that both were similar in terms of OS and PFS.

We then compared both with a cox regression, where OS shows no significant difference between palbociclib and ribociclib when adjusted to the stage, visceral metastases, age, treatment line, combination and ECOG. The proportional hazards' assumption was confirmed with p values all over 0.10  (Table \ref*{tab:cox})

When comparing endocrine therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors as first-line treatment (figure \ref*{fig:grouped}), we see that only Ribociclib is significantly better ( PFS p-value $\le$ 0.001). For this study we only compared patients with bone only metastasis. When comparing palbociclib as the first line, we see that there is no significant difference in terms of PFS and OS (p=0.57 and 0.51). We also applied the same analysis but comparing only the letrozole combination with letrozole alone. We found that both ribociclib and palbociclib are significantly better in terms of PFS (HR 0.65 for palbociclib and 0.27 for ribociclib) but not OS.

When comparing palbociclib and ribociclib adjusted for ATE weights, we found a different scenario from previous assessments. There is a significant difference between the two in terms of OS  (figure \ref*{fig:propensity}). The weights were calculated as stated in the methods section.

The Cox regression adjusted for the variables and with the weights applied to render an HR=0.55 [95\% CI 0.28-1.09;p=0.086] for OS. The HR for PFS is 0.56 [95\% CI 0.32-1;p=0.05].
